	  <p><a href='https://pdxhackerspace.org'>PDX Hackerspace</a> is currently producing face shields and delivering them free of charge to first responders, medical professionals and other front line professionals at elevated risk from COVID-19.</p>
	  <p>As of March 31 we are transitioning to the new <a href='https://3dprint.nih.gov/discover/3dpx-013309'>"Budmen" NIH face shield</a> from the <a href='https://www.prusa3d.com/covid19/'>Prusa Research’s Face Shield</a>. Both are approved for use in medical situations.</p>
	  <p>If you have already printed the Prusa Research Face Shield <b>we can still use them</b>. Please start printing the NIH shield instead, but also drop off any Prusa components you've already printed, too.</p>

            <div>
              <p>
                This face shield has a 3D printed component and a laser cut acrylic component. It can help protect
                medical professionals, first responders and other people who may be in risky, high contact situations.
                It can also help free up more specialized protective gear for people working in ICUs, surgeries and with
                COVID-19 infected patients.
              </p>
              <p>
                3D printing is currently the bottleneck in our ability to deliver these shields. We need your help
                printing more components for the shields.
              </p>

          <ol style="line-height: 2em; font-weight: 600;">
            <li>If you feel sick please take care of yourself and wait to print until you're recovered</li>
            <li>Always wash hands with soap and water for 20 seconds before touching the prints or filament - <a
                href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PmVJQUCm4E'>How to wash with soap and water</a></li>
            <li>Always wear a face mask or shield of some sort in order to protect yourself from touching your face and
              to prevent droplets from you speaking, sneezing, coughing, etc, entering the environment</li>
            <li>When removing a completed print from the printer, please follow these guidelines:
              <ol>
                <li style='list-style-type: lower-alpha'>Put on a fresh pair of gloves</li>
                <li style='list-style-type: lower-alpha'>Pour some of hand sanitizer on your gloved hands and scrub, or
                  wash with soap and water for 20 seconds with the gloves on</li>
                <li style='list-style-type: lower-alpha'>Take 3D prints off each bed and place in a collection container
                  or bag</li>
                <li style='list-style-type: lower-alpha'>Restart all prints (with the gloves on, AFTER you have moved
                  all the prints)</li>
                <li style='list-style-type: lower-alpha'>Dispose of gloves</li>
              </ol>
            <li>It's important that other occupants of the space where your printers are also follow these rules and do
              not touch or breath on the printers or printed components</li>
          </ol>

          <h2>Can I print them from PLA / other materials?</h2>

          <p>PETG is preferable due to its mechanical properties, it doesn’t break/shatter as easily as PLA and it has
            better temperature resistance. Since we need the headband to be slightly elastic, we would suggest sticking
            to PETG. Many sterilization procedures also consist of heating the shield to over 60°C (140+ degrees
            Fahrenheit) - PLA isn’t suitable for such temperatures. ASA and ABS are better alternatives than PLA if PETG
            isn't available.</p>

	  <p><b>If you print with a material other than PETG please include a note with your prints letting us know what
	    material you used. Thank you!</b></p>


          <h2>We Also Need Filament</h2>

          <p>If you have spare plastic filament you'd like to donate, we are using up filament rapidly. We currently
            need 1.75mm PETG in any color.</p>
          <p>Let us know how many kg of filament you're donating. We can send you a donation receipt after we catch our
            breath from production only if you let us know by using the <a
              href='https://immediate-needs.pdxhackerspace.org/'>Give/Get Resources form</a> to confirm the donation.
            Please follow the delivery instructions below.</p>

          <p>Use the delivery instructions below. Please make sure that any opened filament is wrapped in a watertight
            package like a plastic bag.</p>

          <h2>Let Us Know You're Helping</h2>

          <p>If you intend to help with this please let us know by using the <a
              href='https://immediate-needs.pdxhackerspace.org/'>Give/Get Resources form</a> so that we can count you in
            and keep you in the loop as things change.</p>

          <h2>Delivery</h2>

          <p>When you have a batch you’d like to share with us, you can deliver them to PDX Hackerspace or contact us at
            <a href='mailto:ppe@pdxhackerspace.org'>ppe@pdxhackerspace.org</a> to arrange for us to pick them up from
            you.
            If you can remove any supports that will save us time, but please don’t let that get in the way of
            delivering them.</p>
          <p>Please bag them up (ziplock, trash bag, paper bag) and deliver them to 7600 N Interstate Ave. The drop-off
            point is on N Russet, just behind the building and over the fence. Please do not enter PDX Hackerspace.
