  A pleated fabric face mask made of quilter's cotton, with a pocket for optional filter material. We do <b>not</b> recommend these masks for clinical use.
</p>
<p>
  We currently use Scott brand shop towels for filter material, but you may substitute these with your own. Higher quality filter materials, consider furnace or vacuum cleaner bags may be available in your area. Please be careful about constricting airflow for individuals with asthma and other underlying respiratory conditions.

<p>
  For first responders, health-care professionals and emergency managers in and around Multnomah County, you can request fabric masks through the <a href="https://multco.us/em/need-resources-multnomah-county-resource-request-form">Multnomah County Resource Request Form</a> Multnomah County Emergency Management can also provide face masks that are approved for clinical use.

  The MVMask ties behind the head and does not attach to the ears, so it does not need EarSavers.
