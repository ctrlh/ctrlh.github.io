  A face mask made of fabric (quilter's cotton), with a pocket for optional filter material. We do <b>not</b> recommend these masks for medical use.
</p>
<p>
  We currently use Scott brand shop towels for filter material, but you may replace these with your own. You may be able to source higher quality filter material from HEPA filters (consider furnace or vacuum cleaner bags). Please be careful about constricting airflow for individuals with asthma.

  If you are a health-care organization, health-care professional or emergency manager in and around Multnomah County, you will be able to source more fabric masks via the county than we can provide. Please see the <a href="https://multco.us/em/need-resources-multnomah-county-resource-request-form">Multnomah County Resource Request Form</a> to contact the county. Multnomah County can also provide face masks that are approved for use in medical environments.
