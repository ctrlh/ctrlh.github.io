<p>
  A face shield made mostly of cut mylar sheets. This is our lightest face shield. We can produce this shield in large quantities, quickly. If you need 100 shields or more, please consider this option.
</p>
<p>The shield has a fully covered top to prevent droplets falling onto the eyes. It is spaced from the wearer's face to accomodate large goggles.</p>
<p>
  The clear mylar in this shield cannot withstand high temperature sterilization. We recommend sanitizing it chemically with bleach or hydrogen peroxide.
