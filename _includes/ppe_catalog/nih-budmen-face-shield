<p>
  NIH's Budmen Face Shield has undergone review in a clinical setting and is recommended when fabricated as instructed.
</p>
<p>
  The shield has a fully covered top to prevent droplets falling onto the eyes. It is spaced from the wearer's face to accomodate large goggles.
</p>
<p>
  The clear mylar in this shield cannot withstand high temperature sterilization. We recommend sanitizing it chemically with bleach or hydrogen peroxide.
</p>
<p>
  The 3d printed components of this shield limit our rate of production. If you need many shields (> 100) we recommend considering the <a href="#origami-face-shield">Origami Face Shield</a>.
