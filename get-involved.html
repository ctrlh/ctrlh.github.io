      <h3>Getting Involved</h3>
	  
<p>
PDX Hackerspace is an open and welcoming community of technology enthusiasts. Unfortunately, due to the practical limitations of our physical space, we sometimes need to deny applicants full membership to the Hackerspace. Even though any denial can be somewhat jarring and an ego hit, this is not at all our intent. Since our founding, our intent has been to do the most good for the most people using what we have. Unfortunately, we sometimes need to send out denials to potential members as a result.
</p><p>
We strive to be as inclusive as possible by providing many non-member opportunities to be a part of our community.

            <h3>Open Events</h3>
            <p>PDX Hackerspace hosts several open events each week that are welcoming, inclusive and free to attend for everyone. Check out our <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://pdxhackerspace.org/calendar">calendar of events here.</a></p>

            <h3>Online Collaboration</h3>
            <p>Since we're limited by our physical space, sometimes the best way to collaborate is on the Internet. We are active on Patreon, Kofi, Twitter, Twitch, Facebook, Instagram, Linkedin and many other platforms. We're always looking to engage with others and talk about interesting projects on which our community is working. Whichever is your online platform of choice, we'll see you on the Internet!</p>

            <h3>Volunteer Opportunities</h3>
            <p>PDX Hackerspace sometimes has a need for volunteers. This is also a time for non-members to interact with members, letting those members get to know how awesome they are! This is also a time to potentially create other collaborative opportunities between members and non-members. These types of volunteer opportunites are typically announced on social media, but if you're a potential volunteer who has a special skill that might be beneficial to the Hackerspace, please don't wait to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://forms.gle/s5DcvPS5isbNY96QA">get in touch!</a></p>
