                    <h2>Creative problem solving</h2>

                    <p>
                        PDX Hackerspace attracts the most creative members of the engineering, fabrication and technical
                        communities from across northwest Oregon. The space has developed a deep understanding of what
                        different technologies can practically produce. We are uniquely positioned to answer question
                        like “Can This PPE be 3D printed, and at what volume”, “what is a viable substitute 3M N95
                        filter material, and can we cut it into a shape that fits our respirators”, “What are the
                        security risks to this method of data collection” “Can we provide real time visualization of X
                        set of data”. In short we can answer questions about how technology can help.
                    </p>

                    <h2>We Have Stock On Hand</h2>

                    <p>We also have stock on hand of many materials vital to the production of PPE (specifically a large
                        stock of clear plastic used in the production of face shields and splash shields).</p>

                    <h2>Our Own Initiative</h2>

                    <p>We are offering our services free of charge to organizations with needs associated with fighting
                        the COVID-19 pandemic in the Portland Metropolitan area and beyond.</p>
                    <p>On our own initiative we have begun production of various PPE items. For example we are currently
                        producing plastic face shields suitable for use by emergency responders and medical
                        professionals. We have also produced valves and respirator parts as requests come in from
                        individuals in the healthcare profession.</p>
