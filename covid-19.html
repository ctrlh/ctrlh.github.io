                            <h2>Creative problem solving</h2>

                            <p>
                                The Portland Hackerspace attracts the most creative members of the engineering, fabrication and technical communities from across northwest Oregon. The space has developed a deep understanding of what different technologies can practically produce. We are uniquely positioned to answer question like “Can This PPE be 3d printed, and at what volume”, “what is a viable substitute 3M n95 filter material, and  can we cut it into a shape that fits our respirators”, “What are the security risks to this method of data collection” “Can we provide real time visualization of X set of data”. In short we can answer questions about how technology can help.
                            </p>

                            <h2>We Have Stock On Hand</h2>

                            <p>We also have stock on hand of many materials vital to the production of PPE (specifically a large stock of clear plastic used in the production of face shields and splash shields)</p>

                            <h2>Our Own Initiative</h2>

                            <p>We are  offering our services free of charge to organizations with needs associated with fighting the COVID-19 outbreak in the Portland Metropolitan area.</p>
                            <p>On our own initiative we have begun production of various PPE items. For example we are currently producing plastic face shields suitable for use by emergency responders and medical professionals. We have also produced valves and respirator parts as requests come in from individuals in the healthcare profession.</p>
