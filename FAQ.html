      <h3>Do I need to be a member?</h3>
      
<p>
No membership required! All events listed on our calendar, unless explicitly stated otherwise, are open to everyone. In fact, if you have a limited schedule and can't make one of these events, or if you are in town visiting from another Hackerspace, use this <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href='https://forms.gle/s5DcvPS5isbNY96QA'>form</a> and we'll do our best to have one of our members give you a tour that works with your schedule, and in the latter case, maybe even get you a guest pass while you're in town visiting!

      <h3>How do I become a member? What do I get with membership?</h3>
      
<p>
PDX Hackerspace membership costs $40 per month. There is an application process. Unless you have a referral from an existing member, part of the application process is showing up in person, getting a tour, then submitting an application. Applications are approved on a weekly basis, but there is sometimes a queue of several weeks. Once approved and given member orientation, which takes about 30 minutes, as a member you'll have 24/7 access to the Hackerspace. You'll also have access to our shared equipment and tools, provided you've been signed off on them. The sign off / training process happens most Friday evenings and is by request. If you have any questions about membership that were not covered here, use this <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href='https://forms.gle/s5DcvPS5isbNY96QA'>form</a> and let us know.

      <h3>Are there additional costs beyond the membership dues?</h3>
      
<p>
Yes, some of the equipment, materials, classes and workshops have an additional cost. These fees are determined by administrators, equipment hosts and instructors. We try to keep costs low for our members and cover as much as we can from membership dues.

      <h3>Do you have internships?</h3>
      
<p>
We don’t offer internships, however, there are many learning and volunteering opportunities at the Hackerspace. The best way to get involved is to get to know other Hackerspace members and volunteers and ask what their needs are or ask how you can help. Whatever your area of interest, chances are there’s a way for you to contribute to the Hackerspace and learn from it.
