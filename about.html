      <h3>Who We Are</h3>
	  
<p>
PDX Hackerspace is a non-profit organization promoting and encouraging technical, scientific and artistic skills through individual projects, social collaboration and education. We are located at 7608 N Interstate Avenue in Portland, Oregon and serve as a local community hub as well as a thriving online community with roots extending around the world. 
</p><p>
Our organization provides two unique, very deep universal needs. Two needs that have been way too scarce for way too long. Community and Creative Expression. We evolved as a species on the planet to survive in a sometimes hostile environment, and have done so by supporting each other in community. We need community. One of the things we did in community was get together to make and share useful tools. And just because we, as a species, might be able to now buy the things we need doesn’t mean we don’t also need to create. We have a deep inner drive to create. It’s who we are.

      <h3>What We Do</h3>
      
<p>
The essence of hacking is to take something, improve it, then share it with the rest of the world. Our Hackerspace fosters supportive community where individuals teach because they love teaching and learn because they love learning; All geared towards enabling individuals to live the lives they want to live.
</p><p>
We exist for a couple really important reasons. One is that real education happens at Hackerspaces. As education bureaucracies around the world continue to sometimes fail us, Hackerspaces will continue to fill in more of the void, where people teach because they love teaching and where people learn because they love learning. And secondly, local economies grow at Hackerspaces. Hackerspaces provide supportive community for exploring and doing what you love. And if you do what you love, chances are really good other people are going to love it too, and in a capitalist society, if people love what you do, people will pay you to do it. Many companies have grown this way, so if your company grows and you need help, you can hire from the local community! This creates local economy that works for everyone. The future of economies everywhere is creative and Hackerspaces are a fantastic place to explore your creativity.
